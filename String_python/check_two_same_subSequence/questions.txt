Check if two same sub-sequences exist in a string or not

Given a string, the task is to check if there exist two equal sub-sequences in the given string. Two sub-sequences are said to be equal if they have the same characters arranged in the same lexicographical order but the position of characters differs from that in the original string. 

Examples: 
 

Input: str = “geeksforgeeks” 
Output: YES 
Two possible sub-sequences are “geeks” and “geeks”. 
Input: str = “bhuvan” 
Output: NO
