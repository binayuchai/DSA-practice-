Find all the patterns of “1(0+)1” in a given string (General Approach)


A string contains patterns of the form 1(0+)1 where (0+) represents any non-empty consecutive sequence of 0’s. Count all such patterns. The patterns are allowed to overlap.

Note : It contains digits and lowercase characters only. The string is not necessarily a binary. 100201 is not a valid pattern. 

Examples: 

Input : 1101001
Output : 2

Input : 100001abc101
Output : 2
