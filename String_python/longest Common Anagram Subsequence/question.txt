Given two strings str1 and str2 of length n1 and n2 respectively. The problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence which is present in both the strings in the form of anagrams. 

Note: The strings contain only lowercase letters.

Examples: 

Input : str1 = "abdacp", str2 = "ckamb"
Output : 3
Subsequence of str1 = abc
Subsequence of str2 = cab
          OR
Subsequence of str1 = bac
Subsequence of str2 = cab

These are longest common anagram subsequences.

Input : str1 = "abbcfke", str2 = "fbaafbly"
Output : 4
