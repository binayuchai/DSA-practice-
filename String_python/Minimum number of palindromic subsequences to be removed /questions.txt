Given a binary string, count minimum number of subsequences to be removed to make it an empty string.

Examples : 

Input: str[] = "10001"
Output: 1
Since the whole string is palindrome, 
we need only one removal.

Input: str[] = "10001001"
Output: 2
We can remove the middle 1 as first 
removal, after first removal string
becomes 1000001 which is a palindrome
